*Example of a 2x 120 mm fan shroud*

This OpenSCAD document creates a fan duct to guide air from case fans to a heatsink, such as that of a deshrouded GPU.

It supports 1-by-n fan setups and can be easily customised to suit your needs, with the variables at the top of the document allowing for most dimensions to be changed. Ensure these are set to suit your application. The shape of the duct exhaust is fully customisable.
