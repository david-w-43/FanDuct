*Example of a 2x 120 mm fan shroud with slotted holes and reinforcement*

This OpenSCAD document creates a fan duct to guide air from case fans to a heatsink, such as that of a deshrouded GPU.

It supports 1-by-n fan setups and can be easily customised to suit your needs, with the variables at the top of the document allowing for most dimensions to be changed. Ensure these are set to suit your application. The shape of the duct exhaust is fully customisable, with a configurable shape and optional cutouts.

The example values used in this project are for an MSI GTX 960 in a Fractal Design Node 202. This has slotted holes for easier alignment, and reinforcement to help support the card.
